#    HOME AUTOMATION

In this project report, it explains how a reliable and
an authentic wireless communication could be
easily developed between a mobile phone and
microcontroller using GSM (Global System for
Mobile Communication) MODEM (ModulatorDemodulator).
 This report explains GSM based
home automation system which can be widely used
for multitude of applications including educational
sector, traffic control, banks, public advertisements
etc.

## OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this project is to
design a control system, that will act as an
embedded system which can monitor and control appliances and other devices locally.
The proposed approach for designing this system is
to implement a microcontroller-based control
module that receives its instructions and command
from a cellular phone over the GSM network. The
microcontroller then will carry out the issued
commands.

## Tasks:
* Sending message from any of the remote
area to the home appliances using GSM
mobile.
* For sending the text message from remote
area we need to interface the mobile phone
with GSM Modem.
* For developing some of GSM based
applications we need to have some
commons peripherals including GSM
MODEM, SIM, microcontroller, LCD
(Liquid crystal display), power supply and
also some connecting wires as per the requirement.
